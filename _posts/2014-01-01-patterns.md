This document describes some NSQ patterns that solve a variety of common
problems.

DISCLAIMER: there are *some* obvious technology suggestions but this document
generally ignores the deeply personal details of choosing proper tools, getting
software installed on production machines, managing what service is running
where, service configuration, and managing running processes (`daemontools`,
`supervisord`, `init.d`, etc.).

### Metrics Collection

Regardless of the type of web service you're building, in most cases you're
going to want to collect some form of metrics in order to understand your
infrastructure, your users, or your business.

For a web service, most often these metrics are produced by events that happen
via HTTP requests, like an API. The naive approach would be to structure
this synchronously, writing to your metrics system directly in the API request
handler.

![naive approach](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mf74kh5r4P1qj3yp2.png)

 * What happens when your metrics system goes down?
 * Do your API requests hang and/or fail?
 * How will you handle the scaling challenge of increasing API request volume
   or breadth of metrics collection?

One way to resolve all of these issues is to somehow perform the work of
writing into your metrics system asynchronously - that is, place the data in
some sort of local queue and write into your downstream system via some other
process (consuming that queue). This separation of concerns allows the system
to be more robust and fault tolerant. At bitly, we use NSQ to achieve this.

Brief tangent: NSQ has the concept of **topics** and **channels**. Basically,
think of a **topic** as a unique stream of messages (like our stream of API
events above). Think of a **channel** as a *copy* of that stream of messages
for a given set of consumers. Topics and channels are both independent queues,
too. These properties enable NSQ to support both multicast (a topic *copying*
each message to N channels) and distributed (a channel *equally dividing* its
messages among N consumers) message delivery.

For a more thorough treatment of these concepts, read through the [design
doc][design_doc] and [slides from our Golang NYC talk][golang_slides],
specifically [slides 19 through 33][channel_slides] describe topics and
channels in detail.

![architecture with NSQ](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mf74ktpfpP1qj3yp2.png)

Integrating NSQ is straightforward, let's take the simple case:

 1. Run an instance of `nsqd` on the same host that runs your API application.
 2. Update your API application to write to the local `nsqd` instance to 
    queue events, instead of directly into the metrics system.  To be able 
    to easily introspect and manipulate the stream, we generally format this
    type of data in line-oriented JSON.  Writing into `nsqd` can be as simple
    as performing an HTTP POST request to the `/put` endpoint.
 3. Create a consumer in your preferred language using one of our 
    [client libraries][client_libs].  This "worker" will subscribe to the 
    stream of data and process the events, writing into your metrics system. 
    It can also run locally on the host running both your API application 
    and `nsqd`.

Here's an example worker written with our official [Python client
library][pynsq]:

{% gist 4331602 %}

In addition to de-coupling, by using one of our official client libraries,
consumers will degrade gracefully when message processing fails.  Our libraries 
have two key features that help with this:

 1. **Retries** - when your message handler indicates failure, that information is
    sent to `nsqd` in the form of a `REQ` (re-queue) command.  Also, `nsqd` will
    *automatically* time out (and re-queue) a message if it hasn't been responded 
    to in a configurable time window.  These two properties are critical to 
    providing a delivery guarantee.
 2. **Exponential Backoff** - when message processing fails the reader library will
    delay the receipt of additional messages for a duration that scales 
    exponentially based on the # of consecutive failures.  The opposite sequence
    happens when a reader is in a backoff state and begins to process
    successfully, until 0.

In concert, these two features allow the system to respond gracefully to 
downstream failure, automagically.

### Persistence

Ok, great, now you have the ability to withstand a situation where your
metrics system is unavailable with no data loss and no degraded API service to
other endpoints. You also have the ability to scale the processing of this
stream horizontally by adding more worker instances to consume from the same
channel.

But, it's kinda hard ahead of time to think of all the types of metrics you
might want to collect for a given API event.

Wouldn't it be nice to have an archived log of this data stream for any future
operation to leverage? Logs tend to be relatively easy to redundantly backup,
making it a "plan z" of sorts in the event of catastrophic downstream data
loss. But, would you want this same consumer to also have the responsibility
of archiving the message data? Probably not, because of that whole "separation
of concerns" thing.

Archiving an NSQ topic is such a common pattern that we built a
utility, [nsq_to_file][nsq_to_file], packaged with NSQ, that does
exactly what you need.

Remember, in NSQ, each channel of a topic is independent and receives a
*copy* of all the messages. You can use this to your advantage when archiving
the stream by doing so over a new channel, `archive`. Practically, this means
that if your metrics system is having issues and the `metrics` channel gets
backed up, it won't effect the separate `archive` channel you'll be using to
persist messages to disk.

So, add an instance of `nsq_to_file` to the same host and use a command line
like the following:

```
/usr/local/bin/nsq_to_file --nsqd-tcp-address=127.0.0.1:4150 --topic=api_requests --channel=archive
```

### Distributed Systems

You'll notice that the system has not yet evolved beyond a single production
host, which is a glaring single point of failure.

Unfortunately, building a distributed system [is hard][dist_link].
Fortunately, NSQ can help. The following changes demonstrate how
NSQ alleviates some of the pain points of building distributed systems
as well as how its design helps achieve high availability and fault tolerance.

Let's assume for a second that this event stream is *really* important. You
want to be able to tolerate host failures and continue to ensure that messages
are *at least* archived, so you add another host.

![adding a second host](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mf74lmYhZa1qj3yp2.png)

Assuming you have some sort of load balancer in front of these two hosts you
can now tolerate any single host failure.

Now, let's say the process of persisting, compressing, and transferring these
logs is affecting performance. How about splitting that responsibility off to
a tier of hosts that have higher IO capacity?

![separate archive hosts](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mf74m0JHMi1qj3yp2.png)

This topology and configuration can easily scale to double-digit hosts, but
you're still managing configuration of these services manually, which does not
scale. Specifically, in each consumer, this setup is hard-coding the address
of where `nsqd` instances live, which is a pain. What you really want is for
the configuration to evolve and be accessed at runtime based on the state of
the NSQ cluster. This is *exactly* what we built `nsqlookupd` to
address.

`nsqlookupd` is a daemon that records and disseminates the state of an NSQ
cluster at runtime. `nsqd` instances maintain persistent TCP connections to
`nsqlookupd` and push state changes across the wire. Specifically, an `nsqd`
registers itself as a producer for a given topic as well as all channels it
knows about. This allows consumers to query an `nsqlookupd` to determine who
the producers are for a topic of interest, rather than hard-coding that
configuration. Over time, they will *learn* about the existence of new
producers and be able to route around failures.

The only changes you need to make are to point your existing `nsqd` and
consumer instances at `nsqlookupd` (everyone explicitly knows where
`nsqlookupd` instances are but consumers don't explicitly know where
producers are, and vice versa). The topology now looks like this:

![adding nsqlookupd](http://media.tumblr.com/edb403d38fc2bcc727b8655ea70eb3a7/tumblr_inline_mf8sfr2sp41qj3yp2.png)

At first glance this may look *more* complicated. It's deceptive though, as
the effect this has on a growing infrastructure is hard to communicate
visually. You've effectively decoupled producers from consumers because
`nsqlookupd` is now acting as a directory service in between. Adding
additional downstream services that depend on a given stream is trivial, just
specify the topic you're interested in (producers will be discovered by
querying `nsqlookupd`).

But what about availability and consistency of the lookup data? We generally
recommend basing your decision on how many to run in congruence with your
desired availability requirements. `nsqlookupd` is not resource intensive and
can be easily homed with other services. Also, `nsqlookupd` instances do not
need to coordinate or otherwise be consistent with each other. Consumers will
generally only require one `nsqlookupd` to be available with the information
they need (and they will union the responses from all of the `nsqlookupd`
instances they know about). Operationally, this makes it easy to migrate to a
new set of `nsqlookupd`.
